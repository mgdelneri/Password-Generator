# Password-Generator

GOAL: 

The overall goal of this project was to create a functional password generator. 

I was given some starter code: completed HMTL and CSS code, and some minimal JavaScript code. The assignment was to alter the JavaScript starter code so that the webpage functioned in a way that, when the "Generate Password" button is clicked, the user receives several prompts asking for their desired password length, as well as what types of characters they would like to include in their password: uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special characters. 

Once the user goes through all of the options available, a password is generated and displayed in the text area on the webpage or on a separate alert window. 

This is an image of the webpage after I altered the JavaScript code, with a generated password shown on the page:

PROCESS: 

Before altering any of the code, I looked carefully through the HTML code. I opened the webpage and made sure I understood where everything in the code was laid out and to which parts of the webpage all of the classes and ids belonged to. Besides reading through the code, I also used Chrome Dev Tools to help me visualize how the code came to life. I also skimmed through the CSS, but did not spend too much time focusing on styling, as it was not essential to the task at hand. 

After looking through the HTML, I looked at the few lines of code in the JavaScript file. I tried wrapping my mind around what this minimal code meant, paying special attention to what sections of the DOM it was already connected to. From there, I started to fill in the page with some pseudo code, which listed tasks I believed should be accomplished to make this password generator functional.
